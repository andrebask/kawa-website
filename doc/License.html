<p>The license for the Kawa software
(except the optional JEmacs and BRL features - see below) is the
<a class="ulink" href="http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php" target="_top">X11/MIT license</a>
which is quoted below.

</pre>
<p>In the past the Kawa license was a "modified GNU GPL (General
Public License)".
If you find any files that contain the old license or otherwise seem
to contradict the new license, please report that as a bug.
</p>
<p>Some of the JEmacs files are based on Emacs and have a GPL license,
which is incompatible with non-Free (proprietary) products.  For that
reason, the <code class="literal">gnu.jemacs.*</code> packages are not included any more in
the standard <code class="literal">.jar</code> or by default when building from source, to
avoid surprises.
To build JEmacs you have to specify the <code class="literal">configure</code>
flag <code class="literal">--enable-jemacs</code> or the <code class="literal">ant</code> flag
<code class="literal">-Denable-jemacs=true</code>.
</p>
<p>Some code in <code class="literal">gnu/brl</code> and <code class="literal">gnu/kawa/brl</code> is copyright
Bruce R. Lewis and Eaton Vance Management,
with a modified-GPL license: no restrictions if used
unmodified, but otherwise the GPL applies.
These packages are no longer included by default in Kawa builds,
but have to be selected with the <code class="literal">configure</code>
flag <code class="literal">--enable-brl</code> or the <code class="literal">ant</code> flag <code class="literal">-Denable-brl=true</code>.
</p>
<p>Kawa uses some math routines from fdlib's libf77,
which have a AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories and Bellcore copyright.
See the source file <code class="literal">gnu/math/DComplex.java</code>.
</p>
<p>The sorting routine in <code class="literal">gnu.xquery.util.OrderedTuples</code>
is a re-implementatiomn in Java of code copyrighted by
Simon Tatham.
</p>
<p>Some of the Scheme code in <code class="literal">kawa/lib</code> and <code class="literal">gnu/kawa/slib</code>
are copyright other parties, and may have slightly different
license wording, but I believe none of then contradicts the
main Kawa license or impose extra restrictions.
Search for the word <code class="literal">copyright</code> in these directories.
</p>
<p>Some code has been converted from other languages, with permission.
This includes the <code class="literal">rationalize</code> method
in <code class="literal">gnu/math/RatNum.java</code>, based on an algorithm of Alan Bawden,
as expressed by Marc Feeley in C-Gambit.
The concepts and algorithm of <code class="literal">gnu/text/PrettyWriter.java</code>
are converted from SBCL, which is in the public domain.
